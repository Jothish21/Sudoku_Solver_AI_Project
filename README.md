This project aims to solve Sudoku puzzles using various artificial intelligence techniques, including Constraint Propagation, Backtracking, Backtracking with Degree Heuristic, and Simulated Annealing. The repository contains the following files:
## Files:

1. **SudokuProblem.py**: Defines the Sudoku puzzle as a numpy array and provides utility functions for puzzle manipulation.
2. **Solver.py**: Implements classes and functions for solving Sudoku puzzles using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) algorithms and Simulated Annealing.
3. **evaluate.py**: Evaluates the performance of each solving algorithm by solving a given Sudoku puzzle and measuring the number of assignments and execution time.
4. **solved_puzzles.py**: Provides examples of how to use the solver classes to solve Sudoku puzzles using different algorithms and displays the solved puzzles.
